# Customer_churn

## Customer Churn : 
It is when a customer is likely to stop doing business or leave you. 
Also known as Customer Attrition.

According to researches, it has been found that it is cost effective to retain your old customers rather than acquiring the new ones. 

Through this project, we observe the multidimesnional behavior of the customer and try to figure if a pattenr is being reflected. This can aslo contribute in identifying trends and improvising in business. 

The Multidimesnional Analysis of Customers gives pretty good insights. It has well classified data. We go through multiple steps such as Exploratory Data Analysis , Cluster Analysis and finally Principal Component Analysis to thoroughly understand the data in Python. 


Once we have understood the Customers' behavior patterns , we further move to predict the customer attrition. The data is properly processed through Problem Definition, Solution Discovery , Best fit Algorithm Search and Finally deploying the same.
